  <h3>Welcome to Focus Mapping!</h3>

  <h3>The hardest part is actually starting.</h3>

  <p>Here are a few things that can help:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear your space.</strong> A messy desk = a messy head.</li>
    <li><strong>Make your workspace a place you want to be in.</strong> Good light matters 🙃.</li>
    <li><strong>Change the environment.</strong> Cafés work for a reason — people around you are also sitting and working.</li>
    <li><strong>Try the Pomodoro technique.</strong> Short focused sprints are easier than "I'll work all day."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is an awesome app for this, where you can grow trees while working:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Record yourself in timelapse.</strong> It's surprisingly motivating (and a bit embarrassing to stop).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What if you can't focus because there are just <em>too many</em> tasks?</h3>

  <p>That happens a lot. Try this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unload your brain.</strong> Write <em>everything</em> down. Think of it as clearing your brain's RAM.</li>
    <li><strong>Use the Eisenhower Matrix.</strong> Sort tasks by what's important and what's urgent.</li>
    <li><strong>Try a reversed to-do list.</strong> If a normal to-do list only makes you feel worse, write down what you've already done instead.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>And honestly?</h3>

  <p>The best motivator is <strong>your conscience</strong>.</p>

  <p>So if you need it — ask us (or just me) to push you, remind you, or check in on your progress.</p>

  <p>Sometimes external pressure is exactly what helps things move.</p>

  <p>Enjoy exploring your focus techniques!</p>
