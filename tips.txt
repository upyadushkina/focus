### Welcome to Focus Mapping!

### The hardest part is actually starting.

Here are a few things that can help:

* **Clear your space.** A messy desk = a messy head.

* **Make your workspace a place you want to be in.** Good light matters 🙃.

* **Change the environment.** Cafés work for a reason — people around you are also sitting and working.

* **Try the Pomodoro technique.** Short focused sprints are easier than “I’ll work all day.”
Here is an awesome app for this, where youc an grow trees while working:

* **Record yourself in timelapse.** It’s surprisingly motivating (and a bit embarrassing to stop).

### What if you can’t focus because there are just *too many* tasks?

That happens a lot. Try this:

* **Unload your brain.** Write *everything* down. Think of it as clearing your brain’s RAM.
* **Use the Eisenhower Matrix.** Sort tasks by what’s important and what’s urgent.
* **Try a reversed to-do list.** If a normal to-do list only makes you feel worse, write down what you’ve already done instead.

### And honestly?

The best motivator is **your conscience**.

So if you need it — ask us (or just me) to push you, remind you, or check in on your progress.
Sometimes external pressure is exactly what helps things move.
