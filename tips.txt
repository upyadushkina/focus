# Focus Mapping Tips

Welcome to the Focus Mapping visualization! Here are some tips to help you navigate:

## Getting Started

- Click on any node to see its details in the popup
- Hover over nodes to see connections highlighted
- Use the filters to find specific techniques

## Control Nodes

The mapping includes several control nodes that transform the visualization:

### Organization
- **tidy up** - Organizes all nodes into columns by their order tags
- **mess up** - Returns nodes to their natural messy layout

### Aesthetics
- **pretty it up** - Transforms colors to a beautiful, calm palette
- **color bombing** - Returns to the vibrant initial colors

### Transformation
- **coworking** - All nodes become 👀 emoji (watching eyes)
- **run away** - Returns nodes to their original circle shapes

### Visibility
- **write down** - Makes all nodes fully visible (100% opacity)
- **keep it** - Reduces nodes to 70% opacity for a subtle view

### Status
- **reversed list** - Highlights completed items (with "done" tag) in green
- **ordinary list** - Returns all nodes to their original colors

### Media
- **animation** - Click to play fullscreen video (press ESC to exit)

## Tips for Using the Mapping

1. Start by exploring nodes and their connections
2. Use "tidy up" to see how techniques are organized
3. Try "pretty it up" for a calmer viewing experience
4. Mark completed techniques with the "done" tag in your CSV
5. Use "write down" when you need full clarity
